1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,290
And this is it for this module.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,220
Now, there is always more you can cover, but I've found it important to all to point you at the official

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:16,040
docs so that you know where you can dive deeper if something is unclear or you are interested in one

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,720
specific features, because Angela is a huge topic.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,210
It's the framework.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,850
And then as you saw in this module, decentered Seelie ecosystem thing.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,610
That's why, as some people refer to ANGULAR as a platform, because it's more than just the framework,

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,940
it's also all these extra tools and helpers and features.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,460
And this ecosystem, of course, also keeps on evolving, which is why the official docs are a great

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,100
resource to dive into the specific features you might be interested in.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,180
Now, of course, discourse is about angular, the framework and how we build web applications with

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,330
it.

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,060
That always was the heart of the course and that is honestly what most developers are interested in.

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,430
You want to learn how to write and build angular applications, but if you want to take your knowledge

15
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,520
to the next step and maybe get a bit more productive with all these Seelie commands with deployment,

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,730
with maybe custom schematics and so on, then this module hopefully showed you what you can do there,

17
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:20,720
where you can learn more and how to read all these configuration files, how to use all these commands,

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,730
how to manage your projects.

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,850
So I hope this was helpful.

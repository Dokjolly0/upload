1
00:00:02,584 --> 00:00:04,330
[Maximilian Schwarzmuller] Angular 14 introduced

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,730
an amazing new feature: Standalone Components.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,060
And over the next minutes,

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,640
I will explain what exactly Standalone Components are,

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,830
why this feature was added, how it works,

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,950
and which problem is solved by it,

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,940
and we'll explore basic Standalone Components,

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,520
along with more advanced use cases,

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,650
like using Standalone Components with services,

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,203
routing, or lazy loading.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,290
I wanna highlight right away, though,

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,610
that this feature was introduced

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,870
with Angular Version 14 in preview mode,

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,080
so as a feature preview.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,630
This means it's not fully stable yet. Details might change.

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,440
It's not the recommended way

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,220
for building production Angular applications,

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,830
and that's why my Complete Guide Course

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,250
does not use Standalone Components as a default,

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,560
but it's very possible

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,230
that Standalone Components will shape the future of Angular

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,160
and might become the default way

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,720
of building Angular Components and Apps

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,450
once all the details have been finalized,

25
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,570
once everything has been polished,

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,480
and once this feature has been battle-tested

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,060
and is the recommended default.

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,640
It's not the case right now,

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,230
but it's still really interesting to dive into this feature

30
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,510
and play around with it,

31
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,693
and that's therefore what we'll do over the next minutes.

00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:08,530
In the last lecture we learned that we have view child and how we can access it in our life cycle hooks

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:17,090
that there is one ever nice little addition in app component where we add our content which we then

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,020
project into our server element.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,840
Let's say we also want to place a local reference on this paragraph.

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,590
So the content paragraph maybe.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,630
But now we want to use that in our server element component which is where this content will end up

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,080
in the end.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,540
Now in the app component which is where we currently placed us in the template we could use at The View

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,300
child because it's in the template of the app component even though it will be kind of passed on to

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,550
the server element component later.

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,950
Since we know that it will be there it would be nice if we could also access it from the server element

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,430
component.

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,980
But at the view child won't work because it's not part of the view.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:06,030
It's part of the content which is why we also have separate hooks your content in it and view in it.

15
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,260
Great thing is we don't only have at view child.

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,590
We also have at content child which also needs to be imported from ad angular core.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,450
There's not also allows us to pass a selector so the reference name content paragraph would be the selector

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:30,700
we chose here in the app component HDMI file and then just like with ET view child we get we can store

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:37,270
this in some property which will be of type element ref like this and now we can use it and just like

20
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:44,490
with view ref we of course can't access to value or anything before we reached content in it.

21
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:53,050
So that's something I just wanted to add at content child to get access to content which is stored in

22
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,910
another component but then passed on via energy content.

23
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:03,690
Now let me locked is and I will log it here and on in it to demonstrate that this is not there.

24
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:12,030
Here I will simply output text content of paragraph

25
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:26,330
whoops paragraph and access this paragraph native element text content and then I will copy this to

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,810
offer content in it.

27
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:37,610
Now once I save this reload the application you see that the first time we call it it's empty here after

28
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,090
on in it but there after an energy after content in it or after this has been called once this hook

29
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,310
has been called we see just a tests now it was initialized.

30
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,350
That is the missing piece.

31
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,830
Understanding how we can get access to elements in our dorm and how we can work with these lifecycle

32
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,460
hooks.

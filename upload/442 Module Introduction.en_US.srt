1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,410
Throughout this course, you learn a lot about angular, of course, the framework, how to build amazing

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,880
apps with it and the many features it includes.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,410
Now, what's all the part of Angular and therefore could also call ANGULAR a platform and not just a

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:23,070
framework, is the SEAL, AI and the entire infrastructure it gives you around your projects and around

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,990
your code, because the code, of course, is the heart.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,310
The framework allows us to build amazing web applications.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,370
But with the SEAL, AI and the project which is configured and a lot of useful tools around declined

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,360
around your projects, you actually also can have a very easy and great time building, publishing,

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,940
deploying and managing your angular projects.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,540
And that's exactly what we'll have a closer look at this module in detail.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,680
We'll have a look at Angella Project and the different configuration files again so that we understand

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,760
what we really can do there and what their role is.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,380
You will see how you can create and manage projects and many things inside of these projects.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,460
We'll take a look at something which is called Schematics and Builders, which is a set of pretty cool

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,090
features, which is included in angular projects at the angular Seelie and which is worth knowing about.

16
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,870
We'll have a look at projects, apps and also how to build libraries, because thus far in this course,

17
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,710
of course, you learned how to build Web applications with ANGULAR.

18
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,160
Now, what have you wanted to build a library that can be used in multiple projects.

19
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,570
That's also something we'll have a look at.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,390
And we'll also have a look at a couple of other things.

21
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,850
For example, at deployment, browser support and much more.

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,940
So let's dive in.

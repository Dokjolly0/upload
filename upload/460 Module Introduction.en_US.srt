1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,090
Now this course section is optional

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,900
because this course section will act

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,810
as an introduction to TypeScript, the programming language

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,810
which we are going to use for all

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,320
this entire course, since Angular embraces TypeScript.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,620
But TypeScript in the end is just a programming language

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,270
extending Java script.

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,360
So if you know Java script, learning TypeScript

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,370
is rather straight forward, and you should be able

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,060
to learn those key TypeScript features by simply going

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,450
through the course step-by-step.

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,760
Nonetheless, in this course section

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,250
if you wanna quick introduction to TypeScript

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,390
or you wanna have a summary of the core features,

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,210
I will introduce you to what exactly TypeScript is

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,650
and why we might wanna use it, what its benefits are?

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,410
And we are going to explore some of its key features

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,650
and types, which we use all the time.

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,220
Now, that being said, we will not cover every single

20
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,760
TypeScript feature which you see in this course

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,670
since you will learn it step by step

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,933
when going through the course as mentioned.

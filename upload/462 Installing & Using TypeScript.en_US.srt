1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:05,000
- [Narrator] So now that
we know what TypeScript is,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,966
that we can add types
to our programs with it

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:12,900
and how the syntax generally looks like,

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,933
let's make sure we can all use TypeScript.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,700
And therefore if you
search for TypeScript,

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,600
you can visit typescriptlang.org

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,166
and that's the official TypeScript webpage

8
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,800
where you can learn more about TypeScript

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,266
and where you can also learn
how to install TypeScript.

10
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:33,000
As a side note, if you
want to learn way more

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,766
about TypeScript, I
also do have a complete

12
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:39,966
TypeScript course where I
dive deeply into TypeScript.

13
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:43,300
In this module, I'll
just cover some basics.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,700
So if you want to learn
more my full course

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,766
might be interesting to you as well

16
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:50,433
or the official docs
of course in addition.

17
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,233
So now to install it locally,

18
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,600
we can click here on install locally

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,933
and now we basically need
to run this command here.

20
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:04,100
Now for that, we need to make
sure that Node.js is installed

21
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,833
but we needed this for this
course

22
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:09,933
anyways and therefore that
should already be installed.

23
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,566
So therefore we can now run this command

24
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,566
to install TypeScript.

25
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:16,533
And running this command
will install TypeScript

26
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:18,966
into a specific project.

27
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:22,166
If you wanna install it
globally on your system,

28
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:26,766
then you need to run npm
install -g typescript.

29
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:30,366
But often installing it just
into one specific project

30
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:33,000
is enough so that you
can then use TypeScript

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,766
in that project into which you install it.

32
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:39,233
And therefore that's
what I'll do here now.

33
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,833
I will open my terminal,
which is integrated

34
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:47,333
here into this project and
run npm install typescript.

35
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:52,533
And actually for this I'll
first of all run npm init -y

36
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,266
to create a empty package.json file

37
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,933
because we will need that
to install dependencies

38
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:02,700
and then I'll run npm install typescript.

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,933
And this will now install
TypeScript into this project.

40
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,200
So now TypeScript is installed.

41
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,433
With that installed, we can now invoke

42
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:16,833
the TypeScript compiler and
that is really important.

43
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:21,233
As you learned, TypeScript
is a superset to JavaScript

44
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:25,900
extending the JavaScript
syntax with those extra types.

45
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,166
Now the important thing to
note is that TypeScript code

46
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,833
does not run in the browser though.

47
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,833
So if you try to execute
TypeScript in the browser,

48
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,000
it will fail.

49
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:42,866
Therefore we need to compile
TypeScript to JavaScript.

50
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:46,166
And during that compilation process,

51
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,766
all our type annotations will be removed

52
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:53,800
because JavaScript doesn't
know those annotations.

53
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,566
But it's during this compilation step

54
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:59,433
where we will be notified about errors.

55
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:02,700
In addition to the notification
we get in the IDE already.

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,633
So it's this compilation
step which then will warn us

57
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,933
of potential code problems
if we haven't spotted

58
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:15,533
them in the IDE before and
then it's that compiled code

59
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,333
which will run in the browser.

60
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,866
Now to invoke this compiler,

61
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,866
we need to run this command here npx tsc.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,966
So now if I run npx tsc like this,

63
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:31,566
you'll see that I get an error though.

64
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:34,500
I get this error because
if I run this command

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,966
just like this, then it expects

66
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:41,366
a TypeScript configuration
file in that project folder

67
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:45,766
that tells TypeScript
which files to compile.

68
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:48,900
Now we'll add such a
configuration file later,

69
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,866
for the moment we can run this
command slightly modified.

70
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:56,266
We can point at a file
that should be compiled.

71
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,966
In this case, with typescript.ts.

72
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:03,866
So if I run npx tsc with typescript.ts

73
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:06,500
then this file is getting compiled.

74
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,133
And hence now here I get
one compilation error,

75
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:14,366
the same error my IDE
warned me about before.

76
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,833
So if I haven't spotted it in the IDE,

77
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,466
now I get an error here.

78
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,300
Now you will notice that
a no-typescript.js file

79
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,266
was created nonetheless.

80
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,800
That simply happens because by default

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,100
even if you get an error
during the compilation

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,966
it's still completes.

83
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:36,166
It just warns you because of that error

84
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,066
but it still gives you a JavaScript file.

85
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:43,133
And this JavaScript
file, sorry this one here

86
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,266
is now based on our TypeScript file.

87
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,866
And you'll see it's almost the same code

88
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:52,000
just without the types
and actually it's changed

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,566
const to var because by default right now,

90
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,600
it's still also compiles to code

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,233
such that it runs in
older browsers as well.

92
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,333
That is something which can be overwritten

93
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,466
with the TypeScript conflict file

94
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,933
but we don't have such a conflict file yet

95
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,033
and therefore we have
this code change as well.

96
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:13,600
But of course you see that
other than that it's the same

97
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,633
code as we wrote in the TypeScript file.

98
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:19,633
Now of course we should get
rid of that error though,

99
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:22,666
otherwise using TypeScript
doesn't make any sense

100
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,166
and hence I'll convert my two numbers,

101
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,433
my two strings to numbers

102
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:32,166
and if I save this now, the
error is gone in the IDE.

103
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,366
and if I now compile
again, this also compiles

104
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,800
without errors and we still have the same

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,333
JavaScript output as before.

106
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,366
But now it's this JavaScript
file which we could

107
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:46,033
import here and use here.

108
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:49,200
If I now save this and
then reload this page,

109
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,033
I get seven again but now
if we continue working

110
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:56,566
in the TypeScript file
and then compile it to run

111
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:01,166
in the browser, now we actually
protect ourselves against

112
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:05,300
errors like we hadn't
before, thanks to TypeScript.

113
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,200
And now with that installed
and now that we understand

114
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,866
what this compiler does and
how it this generally works,

115
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:16,266
let's dive into some core
features you need to know

116
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,866
when working with TypeScript
before

117
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:22,766
we then thereafter are ready to use TypeScript with Angular.

1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,100
Now, that's it for this introduction

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,030
to standalone components.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,130
It's now hopefully clear how they generally work,

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,250
how you can convert components to standalone components

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,070
with help of this flag.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,830
That you must add all the things that are used

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,620
inside of a component to this imports array,

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,930
no matter if it's another module or as we had it

9
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,460
in case of the details component,

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,260
if it's a directive or anything like this

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,040
and that with all those standalone components

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,060
and directives, you can get rid of pretty much

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,060
all NG modules, which saves you a lot of boiler plate code.

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,260
Now, you also saw that mixing and matching is possible.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,410
You don't have to migrate everything.

16
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,980
You can migrate some components and still import them

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,070
into your modules or use modules in your components.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,720
That is both possible.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,770
Again, don't forget that it's a preview feature.

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,700
Things might change, things might get easier.

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,580
New features might be added

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,090
but already you can build Angular apps with that,

23
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,480
the recommended stable way is to still use

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,030
NG modules though.

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,790
This feature is primarily meant to be used to play around

26
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,280
with it and test it and find out if it works for you.

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,440
That's the idea behind this feature right now.

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,010
It does, however, have the potential

29
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,090
of simplifying Angular apps in the future.

30
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,980
Maybe this becomes the officially recommended way

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,100
of building Angular components.

32
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,840
Maybe in some future, no more NG modules are needed

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,390
and of course that would be great

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,710
because that would mean less boiler plate code

35
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,690
and that is probably something we all could live with.

36
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,640
For the moment though,

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,670
it is a feature to play around with and experiment with,

38
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,393
and hopefully I could help a bit with all of that.

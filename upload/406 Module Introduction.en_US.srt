Welcome to this module, in this module, we'll dive into angular universal, which is a tool provided

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:16,870
by the angular team basically and strongly built into the Seelie, which allows you to pre render your

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,140
angular application on the fly on the server.

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,010
Now, why is that interesting?

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,040
Here's our recipe book.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,910
And if we inspect the page source here, we see that there actually is not that much to be found.

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,280
Right.

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:38,770
We got a bunch of script imports, some information in our hit section, but then mainly we got nothing.

9
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,140
We got our app route and that is it.

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,830
Now, the reason for this is that angular, of course, is a CLI insight framework and all our content

11
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:53,900
is rendered in the browser after this app has been bootstrapped, which is done by these script files.

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:00,070
Now, there is nothing wrong with that in general, but of course the user sees that.

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,080
But search engines see that and therefore it might be worth exploring a different way of rendering.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:16,030
Our angular app and angular universe is a tool which basically provides a nice bridge from the awesomeness

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,790
we have with Angular in the browser.

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:26,050
This high reactivity to the pre rendering of pages so that the HTML we get back from the server actually

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,580
is a pre rendered snapshot of the page and once it's DENDE runs in the client.

18
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,790
So in the browser it's a single page application again.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,500
So we want to get the best of both worlds and angular Universal can help us with that.

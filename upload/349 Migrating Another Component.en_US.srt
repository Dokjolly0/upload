1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,940
So now that we also migrated this directive,

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,220
let's migrate more components.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,470
And the next step probably would be to migrate

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,520
the WelcomeComponent.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,810
Now here, in this component,

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,410
we therefore also turn this to standalone

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,090
by setting standalone to true,

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,630
and now, we can readd this import

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,650
and also add DetailsComponent to imports here,

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,370
because, as mentioned before,

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,130
if you wanna use a standalone component or directive

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,350
in another component,

13
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,810
you have to add it to the imports array of that component.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,040
In this case, the WelcomeComponent wants to use app-details,

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,510
so we have to add DetailsComponent here

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,200
as an import to the file, and then mention it here

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,403
in the imports array of this component.

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,970
Now, with that, it will fail however.

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,070
Now, for one, we now should remove DetailsComponent

20
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,300
from imports here, not because it's needed technically,

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,240
but because in this module, we only added it,

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,560
because the WelcomeComponent needed the DetailsComponent,

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,800
but since the WelcomeComponent is now itself specifying

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,560
the DetailsComponent already,

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,380
we no longer have to do that here in the module,

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,370
because the AppComponent is not using it.

27
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,200
If it would be, we would keep it here,

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,230
but since it's not, we can remove it here and remove this.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,100
But that's not the reason for the error,

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,960
the reason for the error is that the WelcomeComponent,

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,310
of course, must not be added to declarations anymore,

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,480
because it is now standalone,

33
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,673
we added this flag to it after all.

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,050
Now, we have to do what we did before therefore,

35
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,310
instead of adding it to declarations,

36
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,370
we should add it to imports,

37
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,810
and with that, we migrated another component successfully

38
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,323
and the app still works.

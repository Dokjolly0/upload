00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,200
In the last lectures we did a lot of setup to get the information about the item we're about to edit.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,250
Now let's edit it.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,610
I want to get the item we want to edit and for this in a shopping list service.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:24,620
I'll need a new method which is simply get ingredient which expects to get the index a number and which

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,600
will simply return as the ingredient from our ingredients array.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,600
So the ingredient at this index.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,180
So with that returned we now can reach out.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:42,350
Q Does new method in our shopping added component and store it in the edited item maybe which is an

9
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,360
ingredient self type ingredient.

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:53,310
And we do this whenever we get a new information that we're in the edit mode I should say so here added

11
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:59,930
that item will be said equals you reaching out to the shopping service to the item we get from the get

12
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,280
ingredient method.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,700
And here we simply pass our index so with this we get a lot of information here.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,320
Now we need to update our form if we are in edit mode and for this I want to get access to the forum.

15
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:22,910
Now on the form we do have a local reference f we can use this together with at view child to get access

16
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,920
to it.

17
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:31,070
So here I will actually use at view child and make sure to add the import from at English core.

18
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:41,180
I will reach out to F and this will be the shopping list forum of type and G forum.

19
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,910
So make sure to assign this type here.

20
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,480
Now once we got all the new information inside of the subscribe callback and that is of course important

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,000
outside of there.

22
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,190
This will not be run each time we get a new information but it might be run before we got any information

23
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,270
at all.

24
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,680
So outside would be wrong inside of this callback here.

25
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:10,390
I want to reach out to my forum and call set value here and now I want to assign a new value for the

26
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:18,600
name I will use my editor's item and year the name and for amount you guessed it.

27
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,550
I'll also use my added that item and then the amount and this should make sure that when ever we select

28
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,820
a new item we actually populate the forum with the right values.

29
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:38,220
We can already try this with any sort of running once our page reloads if I click here.

30
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,350
We indeed select the correct item.

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,130
So dad is working as expected.

32
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:50,880
Of course it still adds it as a new items that we need to make sure that if we are editing we correctly

33
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,880
rename this button to to update or something like this and that we then also do update the item and

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,020
don't add a new one.

35
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,910
Let's do this in the next lecture.

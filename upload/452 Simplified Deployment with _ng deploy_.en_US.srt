1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,550
We explored schematics.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:09,990
Now we also have builders, what are builders schematics basically are the tools you run to add something

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,920
to your project.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,870
We did a third party library or with generate a new component or maybe just an update with builders.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,140
You can well build your application for different environments.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,650
There are some built in builders and you build and you test insulin's d basically all execute your code,

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,490
compile your code analyzer code and then for example, optimize it for production, run tests on it,

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,160
or simply tell you how good your code quality is.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,610
So you perform smart build steps there.

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,490
There also is another builder and that is Engy Deployer.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,830
This takes it to the next level.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,940
It will also build your project for production, but then also already go ahead and deploy it to a certain

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,450
host.

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,440
Of course, only some hosts are support there.

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,860
It's basically like with Engy at there needs to be a third party package or tool which supports energy

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,800
deploy so that you can deploy to a host.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,630
These are automation commands which you also can customize ever by writing your own builder or a deployment

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,690
builder, which is pretty advanced, or by hooking into the configuration and adjusting those builders.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,270
Well, let's take a closer look now.

20
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,660
As always, the official documentation is a good place to go.

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,080
And there you will see another deployment.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,280
You can learn more about deployment and also about.

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,850
Engy deploy.

24
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,600
Here, under automatic deployment with the Seelie, you can learn more about that, and here you also

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:54,160
see the currently supported packages or services which supports the energy supply command.

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,220
I'll come back to that.

27
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:01,780
So this is something you can look into and of course, something we already had a look at an angler.

28
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,360
Jason, you can configure some of these boulders like the Energy Build Command.

29
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,780
Now, we had a look at energy build and energy tests throughout this course.

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,150
We saw Angie Lind earlier here and I talked about this configuration.

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,320
So that's something we covered.

32
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,520
Let's focus on energy deploy.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,790
Therefore, as mentioned, you can either, of course, deploy manually as we did it in the deployment

34
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,570
section or you utilize to see if you plan on using one of these services that supports the engine deployment.

35
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,090
And here I want to use angular fire, which in the end simply uses Firebase under DOD.

36
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:43,120
Angle of fire is a package that makes working with Firebase way easier, not just when it comes to deployment,

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,640
but also when it comes to interacting with the database, so on.

38
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,770
But we didn't use it in this course because it's not a firebase, cause I only used Firebase as a dummy

39
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,100
back.

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,270
And still I want to show you how it is and to deploy command could work.

41
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,850
So first of all, we need to add at Angular Fire to our project.

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,500
Why do we need to add this?

43
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,510
Because only after adding this D deploy command supports angle of fire.

44
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,660
How would it otherwise know that it can use this?

45
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:10,950
Right.

46
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,500
So we first of all have to engie at that angle of fire.

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,500
And just as with angular material, this will not just install the package, but also make any adjustments

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,100
which are required and install any other dependencies it might need.

49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,130
So let's wait for this to finish.

50
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:34,750
Now, you'll see as part of me installing this or adding this, I am asked to select a firebase project.

51
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,930
And indeed, here you need a firebase project.

52
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,110
You probably do have one if you followed through this course.

53
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:48,800
If you don't have one, make sure you sign into Firebase for that, you need a Google account using

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,510
Firebase and is free as long as you stay within certain boundaries, which are quite generous.

55
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,250
So sign in there and create a new firebase project once you created that rerun engie ad at a live fire

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
and Schuster's Command.

57
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,180
Now, important, if you're getting any errors here, you also might want to install the firebase tools

58
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,240
globally, firebase dash tools on Mac and Linux with a pseudo in front of it.

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,160
And once you did install those tools.

60
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:27,350
Run Firebase, log in to log into your firebase account and thereafter try and get at a regular fire.

61
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,910
Now, with that, this will add a couple of configuration files here, some firebase configuration files,

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:43,210
and now the neat thing is we can simply run and deploy now and it should automatically pick up at angle

63
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,180
of fire as a deployment option.

64
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,040
You see, it now compiles to code because it runs the entire build process in production mode.

65
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,220
What we normally would do manually dust is here as well, but then it will not stop thereafter.

66
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,700
Instead, it will take to build assets, to build files and ship them onto a server.

67
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,450
So let's wait for this to finish.

68
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,970
Here is finished building this.

69
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,920
We can ignore the warning and now it's uploading the files to Firebase to Firebase Project.

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,310
And once it's finished, it also generated all the hosting configuration files here.

71
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,990
Once it finished, we get a you are all here, which we can enter into the browser.

72
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,740
And there we see our simple angular application.

73
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,470
Now, you can then administer this application both with this configuration file, the Firebase Jason

74
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,320
File, and you can always redeploy it by running end deploy again or of course, all the from inside

75
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,850
your firebase console.

76
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,640
And there you could all connect a different domain with it if you wanted to.

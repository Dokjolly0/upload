00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,450
Before concluding this module one more thing related to our hooks here.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:16,280
We learned about at Vue child which we can use here in the cockpit to get access to element from our

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,550
while Dom from our template.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,260
Let's do the same here in the server element component HDMI follow where we have all these lifecycle

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,150
hooks.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,860
Let's say I want to get access to this heading.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:34,570
So I would simply place a local reference named heading on it therefore I'll add a new ad view child

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,230
property.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,120
Make sure to import view child from angular core.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:49,080
And with that added here all stored is in the header property which is of type element for F as we learned

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,080
which also needs to be imported from angular core.

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,270
And I want to select the heading local reference with a chest placed on this day of year.

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:07,590
So with that we get access to it and now we would expect that we can't use stairs before we reached

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,260
after view in it.

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,040
So let's try it and energy on in it.

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,790
Let me actually console log this

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,260
header and there the native element.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,920
And now let's access something which is definitely a whale on a div and that is the text content if

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,870
we do this and I save this.

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,250
Let's view the console.

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,930
If I reload the application here you see this empty line here.

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,410
This is where I would have expected text content can make this even clearer by outputting text content

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,880
and then while rendering the text content if there were any there is no text content in here as you

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,270
can see an empty space.

25
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,590
If I copy the exact same code and placed as an after view in it here.

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,300
So after the view should have initialized now you will see that here when it's called the second time

27
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,660
after viewing it we see test server.

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,360
So that is the difference between Wilder points of time where these hooks run after view and it gives

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,380
you access to the Template elements.

30
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,640
You can then access them and use their values and so on before does Hook has been reached.

31
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:30,460
You can't do that you can't check the value of some element in your dorm because it hasn't been rendered

32
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:30,840
yet.

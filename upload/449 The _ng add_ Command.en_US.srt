1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:08,420
You might know angular material, it's a third party package actually also maintained by parts of the

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,420
angular team, but totally optional.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,530
It adds components.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:19,190
So pre-built components to your angular app, which follow the material design, spec and material design

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,620
as a design language invented by Google.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,590
It looks the way this page looks like now.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,820
You can check out components here and see which components this offers.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,200
And this is, of course, not the focus of of this module here, but there you can get nice pre-built

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,820
components, which you can then easily drop into your application to use them there.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,290
Now, if you click on Get Started, we see that we can run one simple command to add angular material

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,550
to our project.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,480
Now, let's copy this command and give it a try.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,240
Let's head over to our project, and there I will run energy at at angler's material and angular material

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,050
is not the only package which supports the energy at command.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,470
Every third party package can support it, no matter if it's built by the angler team or not.

16
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,810
And there are a lot of third party packages out there.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:17,740
For example, Ionic, which do support it now to support these packages, need to include certain configuration

18
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,130
files in their package source code.

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,690
In the end, an energy add will look for these files and if it finds them, it is able to run.

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,370
Now, these files, which these packages have to include dental energy, add what to do and let's see

21
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,800
what energy it does with angular material.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,420
Lets it enter.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,340
And now you see as a first step, it installs packages through NPM.

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,870
Now, this is not all it will do though, but it's one part of what it does.

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,700
It will install all packages you need to install to use angular material.

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,810
That's the angular material package itself, but also some third party dependencies.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,730
This package needs then some packages or some tools might prompt you for certain choices you have to

28
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,420
make, not all.

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,910
Some have some definite steps which to always execute.

30
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,040
Here, for example, we can choose a default theme with which we want to start.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,720
And here I'll go for Deep Purple and Amber.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,000
We can also choose if you want to use hammocks for gesture recognition.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,690
And it will choose.

34
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,110
Yes.

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,350
Also at Browsr animations with yes, so did we have all these nice animations and hit Enter and now

36
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:31,500
you see it again updates the package that Jason followed because it now installs more dependencies end.

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,110
And that's the interesting part.

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,550
It did not just installs on packages, so it's not just a replacement for NPM install.

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,100
It also updated some other files.

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:49,020
It updated the main TIAs file, the app module angler Jason, the index age HTML file and style cyesis.

41
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,070
So why don't we have a look at all these files to understand what Engy ad did?

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,430
And let's start with Maintenace in May.

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,410
And yes, you see it added to import for Hammer, which is a third party package that helps us with

44
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,490
gesture detection.

45
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,710
And that is it actually.

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,990
In the index HTML file, you see it included some Google fonts, the material icons in the end, and

47
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,870
the Raboteau font which it uses.

48
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,110
So that is an adjustment.

49
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,800
It made their.

50
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:25,320
In the app module, if we have a look there, it actually ad at the browser animations module from angular

51
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,600
animations because some angular material components use animations and of course, those animations

52
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,420
should work in these style us as file.

53
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,060
You see it set some default styles for your website, like a default fund, for example.

54
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,400
And in angler Jason there, let's see what a changed there.

55
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:53,320
There you see that, for example, under the built command, it now also includes our theme stalls so

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,820
that our theme is picked up when we build for production.

57
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,540
So that's the end ad schematic, pretty useful for third party packages that support it because it does

58
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,710
not just install the penances and package Jason it all the fastest, but not just instead.

59
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:17,650
Besides doing that, it also makes a couple of adjustments specified by the third party package that

60
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,210
need to be made so that you can immediately start using this installed third party package.

61
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,790
Now, I did mention and generate and engy update as well.

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,780
What do these schematics do?

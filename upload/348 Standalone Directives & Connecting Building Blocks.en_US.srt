1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,140
So in order to migrate everything

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,460
to Standalone Components and directives and so on,

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,140
let's actually continue with the highlight.directive.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,170
This directive is exported by the SharedModule

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,980
but in this demo app, we only use that module

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,690
and that directive in the details.component,

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,600
which already is a Standalone Component.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,060
Since that is the case,

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,400
we could actually turn this highlight.directive

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,260
into a standalone.directive

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,410
by also adding the standalone flag

12
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,450
to the Directive decorator object like this.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,970
So just as components,

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,320
directives and actually also pipes

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,140
can be turned into standalone building blocks.

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,960
In this case, I'm turning the directive

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,980
into a standalone directive.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,930
Now, with it turned into a standalone directive,

19
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,330
it must no longer be added to any declarations

20
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,200
in any modules, and therefore here in this demo app,

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,240
we can actually get rid

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,920
of the shared.module all together therefore

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,400
because we don't need it anymore.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,780
Now, in the details.component,

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,000
we are, of course, using that SharedModule

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,090
so we should get rid of the import.

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,200
And instead here in the imports array

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,630
of the details.omponent,

29
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,410
we should import the HighlightDirective itself

30
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,030
because that's important.

31
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,310
When you are working with Standalone Components,

32
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,510
standalone directives and so on,

33
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,570
then you always must import them into the other components

34
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,960
where you wanna use them

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,550
or with imports into the modules

36
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,940
where you wanna use them, as shown before.

37
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,440
It's not enough to just add this flag.

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,210
You also need to import the things,

39
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,660
the directives and components you wanna use

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,280
in other components into those other components.

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,400
So in this case, I wanna use the HighlightDirective

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,940
in the details.component

43
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,220
because I'm using it here in my template.

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,770
Hence, I have to add it to imports like this.

45
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,180
But with that flag added here to the directive,

46
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,389
and the directive added here

47
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,940
and the SharedModule gone

48
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,800
because we don't need it anymore,

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,990
everything works as before.

50
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,970
We also got no error here.

51
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,410
And we are now using this component successfully

52
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,020
and we now migrated another building block

53
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,253
to be standalone.

00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,850
Getting started with angular universal is pretty simple if you're using the angular Seelie, which you

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,850
should and which we are doing in this course on the GitHub page of the angular Seelie, you can dive

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,900
into their official documentation and that documentation here.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,580
That's basically a link to the wiki.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:27,710
There you find some link to stories on the right here and then to universal rendering.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,890
That's the article we're interested in here.

7
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,570
You can learn more about how to enable that universal rendering.

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,580
And it's just name Universal, because your angular app then runs on both the client and the server.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,250
So here you learn how to integrate that into an angular Seelie project.

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,230
And thankfully, it's pretty simple.

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,760
It all starts by adding additional dependencies.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,800
So we'll go through that and all the other steps step by step in this module.

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,730
And just one important note.

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,880
I will be using visual studio code in this module simply because I'm recording this at a later point

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,610
of time because it was recorded after the rest of the course was recorded and I switched the IT.

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,560
Now it's still the same code.

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,300
It's still the recipe book.

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:20,930
It's still the same project, just an angular six project that's important with a different ID.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,170
And with that, let's continue and let's dive into all these steps and an able server side rendering

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,820
with angular universal.

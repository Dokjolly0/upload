00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,660
Now to really conclude

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,530
this TypeScript introduction section now,

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,650
let's talk about configuring the TypeScript compiler.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,440
You might recall that before when I executed

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,870
just npx typescript, I got this error here

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,670
that basically a TypeScript configuration file is missing

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,090
and that's why I had to target a specific TypeScript file

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,970
like this to then compile just this file.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,080
Now, sometimes you want to compile all the TypeScript files

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,500
in your project in one go, and you also might want

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,580
to configure how the TypeScript compiler behaves.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,330
And for this, you can add a TypeScript

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,200
compiler config file.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,200
You can do this with npx tsc -- init.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,880
What this does is it adds a tsconfig.json file,

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,960
though I will say, once we work with Angular,

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,510
we don't need to do that because the Angular project

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,617
get TypeScript configuration files out of the box,

19
00:01:01,617 --> 00:01:04,190
and you should really only change them

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,230
if you know what you're doing.

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,100
But here we now got such a TypeScript compiler

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,140
configuration file.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,300
And in there, we got lots of options, which we can set.

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,340
Now, one of the most important options

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,940
is the strict mode option here,

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,033
which by default is set to true.

27
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,550
When using strict mode, TypeScript,

28
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,160
as the name implies does very strict type checking.

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,660
And there are many things which it doesn't allow it,

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,790
like for example, values where it's not able

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,300
to infer the type.

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,470
You then have to explicitly set a type for those.

33
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,373
But that's just one example.

34
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,330
Now, in general, you can read through this config file

35
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,330
to understand these different settings.

36
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,340
And of course, I do talk about them

37
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,220
in way greater detail in my full TypeScript course.

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,670
As I said, with Angular projects,

39
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,700
we get a TypeScript file out of the box

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,570
and therefore, this is not really the focus here

41
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,500
because this default Angular TypeScript compiler file

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,210
will do the trick for us

43
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,870
and we don't really need to change them.

44
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,710
Nonetheless, this is how you can configure

45
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,370
the TypeScript compiler and feel free to dive

46
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,240
into these different options to play around with them.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,470
But with that, we now got all those important

48
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,870
basics out of the way.

49
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,750
And now with that, you're definitely ready to dive

50
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,163
into Angular and TypeScript.

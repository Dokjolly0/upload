00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,250
Welcome to this video, Annual Monster, you went through the whole course and you learned a lot about

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,850
Angular, you should feel confident using its features and building Web apps with it.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,450
Now, you learned about all its core features, some advanced features, how these features work together

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,060
and how you use them in a real application, which you didn't even deployed.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,460
So these are all the building blocks you need to build amazing web applications with it.

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,050
Now, of course, really learning and mastering a framework means using it.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,900
So use it both example projects, pick some Web pages you like and try to rebuild them maybe in easier

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,720
versions of them with angular dive into the individual features of angular, maybe even dive in the

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,990
source code of angler.

10
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,770
It's open source in the end, or have a look at the official documentation to dive deeper into some

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,060
specific use cases.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,220
Also, there are some advanced courses and tutorials available.

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,230
For example, I myself do have some courses on Udemy which allow you to dive deeper or use Angerer in

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:09,470
conjunction with other things like ionic cuttable mobile applications or together with notebooks as

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,090
a backend.

16
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,790
These are all great next steps and whether that's a course by me, some other tutorial or in your own

17
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,120
example project, I'd be very interested in seeing what you build, what you do.

18
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,620
So definitely send me a message if you build some amazing project or anything like that.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,940
All the best to you.

20
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,620
See you maybe in other courses and simply have a great time.

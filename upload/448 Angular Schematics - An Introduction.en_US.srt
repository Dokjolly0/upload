What are Angler Seelie schematics, schematics are a powerful tool or a concept introduced by the Angler

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:18,050
team or specifically by the Angler SEAL team schematics are basically blueprints which certain angler

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,430
commands can pick up.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,310
And, for example, you can have schematics for and generate to generate new building blocks in your

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,190
app like components for Engy Add, which we hadn't had a closer look at yet for adding, for example,

6
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:37,760
libraries or certain capabilities to a project and energy update for keeping a project up to date,

7
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,060
you can build your own schematics.

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,210
Angular has some built in schematics which you have unlocked by default, and the angular Seelie and

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,180
third party packages can also add schematics.

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,330
And that's what makes this feature powerful.

11
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,580
Now, adding your own schematics, of course, a super powerful because you could build your own blueprints,

12
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,620
your own energy, generate command for generating, let's say, a specific version of a component which

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,460
you need all the time.

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,960
But let me also say that building your own schematics is not trivial.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,320
If you search for angular schematics, you will find an introduction on the official angle, angular

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,320
block and also something the official documentation.

17
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,240
And there you also have this offering schematics, part where you learn how to build your own schematics.

18
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,500
It is fairly introductory, but it might be a nice start.

19
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,390
If you want to learn all about that.

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,970
It will be a lot of trial and error, though.

21
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,090
And I can also recommend checking out some third party applications schematics because that's what I

22
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,260
now want to focus on.

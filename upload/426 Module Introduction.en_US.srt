Hi, everyone, welcome to this video.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:13,180
In this video, Wiltern online only angular application into offline available one by adding a service

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,510
worker and as you will see, does a super easy to do with Angular.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,570
And I will show you how to turn into such an application and how you can then also configure it to fully

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,650
meet your needs.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,970
So let's dive in.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,560
We'll start with this very simple, angular application here, and you can find to code to that project

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,770
attached to this video, and this is obviously a very well simple, not too exciting, angular app.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,870
It is rendering a list of blog posts, dummy blog posts, which are fetched in our app component here

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,560
from Jason Placeholder.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,660
All that is just a page exposing a dummy rest API, which you can use to get some demo data to display

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,410
on your page.

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,680
You can also send dummy post requests to them and so on.

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,260
But that's not what we'll do.

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,010
We'll focus on getting data.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,000
So this is normal a'la app.

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,060
Not too many features, but it represents a typical angular app.

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,080
We got more than one component and we also got our posts.

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,910
And if you watch closely, you'll see them all using some special fund, which I'm actually pulling

20
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,190
in in my index HTML file here.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,110
I'm importing this OSVALD font here from Google fonts.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,840
So this is what makes up our angular app.

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:38,280
Now if we inspected in Chrome, we can go to the application tab here and developer tools and we can

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,910
turn this to offline mode, which means we're still online.

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,640
We don't have to quit our wi fi network.

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,050
But this will simulate that we got no Internet connection.

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,120
And if I now reload the page, well, obviously I get an error that we don't have an Internet connection.

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,470
If I go back online, it works again.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,270
Now, let's see how we can actually fix this or change this behavior with the help of a service worker

30
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,230
and how we can easily add such a service worker to the app with angular.

1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,460
Now, let's start with Engy generate, we know engy generate, right, we can use it in any angle,

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:14,690
a project that is because Angular and or Seelie has some default blueprints included, for example,

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,410
for generating a component, for generating a pipe, a service and so on.

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,470
So these are basically schematics or support for the energy generate schematic that is already built

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,710
in.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,260
But you could add your own and third party packages can also add their own, not just for energy add,

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,730
but also for energy generate.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,490
For example, with angular material installed here, we can run and generate.

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:45,710
At Angler's Materials, basically the name of the schematic provider by default, if you leave this

10
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:51,140
empty, it's the default Selya, the default angular set up, but you can override it and use a different

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,210
one in this case to a material package.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,750
Colen then a name of a supported schematic, and there, for example, NARTH, and of course, in the

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,220
official docs of Anglo material.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,790
In this case, you learn all about the energy generate schematics it added and you can use.

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,800
So here we can use NARTH and then Aname where we want to create our, in this case, navigation set

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:12,890
up.

17
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:19,010
And if I had entered now this uses to generate schematic provided by angular material and it adds a

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,910
new component.

19
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,040
So under the hood it probably uses energy generator component, but it adds a new component which is

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,730
not empty, but which has a different default blueprint in this case.

21
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:36,110
You see, it has a blueprint where we have a side navigation controller, a toolbar, a button, and

22
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:43,960
then also can show some content here, like maybe in a main block, a simple H2 header.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,960
This works.

24
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,520
And now let's include this main NAF component here in app component.

25
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,550
Let's use Main NAV like this.

26
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,030
Make sure that an app module, this was added to declarations.

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:03,170
And if we now run engy serve, you will see a nice navigation which works out of the box using angular

28
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,220
material components.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,670
Thanks to this custom schematic, this energy generates schematic added by the angle of material package.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,510
And you could build something like this on your own as well if you wanted to.

31
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,500
But as I mentioned, a lot of third party package to support it.

32
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,810
So this adds on to the default schematics you already have in an angular project.

33
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,560
And of course, here we got an error because it's not made.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,300
Now, of course, its app, Main NEF.

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,780
Right.

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,610
We can, of course, check the these Lechter here.

37
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,070
So little oversight from my side.

38
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,730
Let me fix this, an app component.

39
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,570
And after fixing this, if you visit, localhost four thousand two hundred.

40
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,050
We get this nice little application here, we're of course, not much is happening, but where we now

41
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,130
could build up on to build an application.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,920
So this is the end.

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,300
You generate schematic and what you have built into the I and a Devil project and how third party packages

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,870
as well as yourself could add new blueprints to it.

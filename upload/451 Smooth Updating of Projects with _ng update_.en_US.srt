1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:09,080
Now, besides energy generate, we also have energy update and energy update is one of the coolest commands

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,820
you can find.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,950
Of course, you want to keep your application up to date.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,420
And thankfully, when Angella releases a new version, typically not everything changes.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,230
So typically updating is fairly trivial.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:26,000
Still, you might have to update a couple of dependencies and package Jason, and maybe there are one

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,640
or two smaller adjustments you need to make in code, maybe very simple ones, but still repetitive

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,110
ones like adjusting a certain import, adding a new setting on a decorator, something like this.

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,000
Now, energy update can be executed like this in a project and it will analyze it and tell you if there

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,590
is something that needs to be updated.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,860
And for that, it basically checks every package which supports this schematic.

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,090
Of course, all angular packages supported Dangler, Seelie itself supports it.

13
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,770
And, for example, some third party packages like angular material, all the supported.

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,920
Now you see here, everything is up to date for me, but if something would not be up to date, it would

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,660
show you a table and tell you how you can update.

16
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,480
Now, for example, then you can run commands like energy update at.

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,120
At Angular Corps at Angular Seelie to update the angular framework packages, this will actually target

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,330
all packages, not just a core package and the angular Seelie package to bring it up to date and run

19
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,470
any migration's.

20
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,140
So any adjustments that might need to be made.

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,860
So DISCOM makes updating super, super simple.

22
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:43,950
And again, if you run just engy update, you will see a table of commands you should run in case your

23
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,050
project is not entirely up to date.

24
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,290
So Engie Update is a command, which is the word for running after every new angular version that was

25
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,350
released to quickly bring your project up to date and ensure that it works with this latest version.

26
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,780
Manually updating wouldn't be that hard.

27
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,230
But of course with Engy update, it gets even easier.

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,310
And these are the three important schematics we have here now.

29
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,920
We also have something which is called builders.

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,880
And what's that?

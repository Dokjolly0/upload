1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,260
So here is the project which was created, and I did open it in visuals studio code, which is a free

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,690
idea which I can strongly recommend for Angela or for Web development in general.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,180
You find words for every operating system and you can install it and you should see something like this.

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,800
Now, I tweaked some settings there.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,290
For example, I installed a special theme here.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,480
I installed the Dakhla theme.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,220
And you can install extensions by going to the extensions area here under the extensions.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,190
And there, for example, if you search for Dacula, you can find that Simmi installed, which of course

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,200
is totally optional.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,580
I also installed the material.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,340
I can seem to have Neisser file icons, which is also optional, and this is also optional.

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:52,420
But my recommendation, I also installed the Angular Essentials extension pack by John PapÃ , which

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,270
installs a couple of extensions that make your life as a regular developer much easier in pseudocode.

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:04,810
So I do recommend as angular essentially an extension after installing all of those and activating them

15
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,410
and reloading, you should have a project that looks something like this.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,440
Now, I did add a prettier RC file to configure Prettier, which is the file for Metcher I'm using.

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,130
And I set it to use single quotes here.

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,900
Basically just how it should auto format my code or the formatting is something you can do with a keyboard

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,650
shortcut here.

20
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,920
If you search for format, document this shortcut.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,990
Will auto format your code with a tool of your choice, in my case, prettier, which is part of that

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,550
angular essentials package.

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,580
And this will make your code easier to read, fix simple errors and simply give you a better time as

24
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,160
a developer.

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,290
This is the starting project, therefore, and this is a typical Angella project as it's generated by

26
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:47,680
the SEAL.

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,450
I haven't changed anything in there.

28
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,210
Now, of course, you know this project, right?

29
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,950
We worked in a project like this for the entire course.

30
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,740
We get the source folder with the app folder, and in there we can add our angular components and services

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,890
and directives, set everything and write our angular app.

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,640
Now, we'll not focus on creating an app in this module.

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,220
Instead will focus on the project and what you can do with the app where the seal I can help you, how

34
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,050
you can deploy this and so on.

35
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,410
So therefore, now that we have this basic setup and we understand what we do have here, we also see

36
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,680
we have tons of configuration files here.

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,900
So why don't we take a closer look at those to fully understand what the seal I gave us there.

00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,310
So we added this angular, universal pre rendering, how would you now deploy this application with

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,970
that added, you would basically still deploy to dist folder, but now you need to deploy it to a server

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:22,440
which is capable of running a node server because your hosting service where you deploy server Jast,

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,060
who needs to execute that server JS file, it needs to run that on the server.

5
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,790
That's really important to understand.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,500
This file needs to be run on the server and therefore you can't use HWC as free anymore.

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,830
For example, you need some server where you can start that file and run it.

8
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,610
With such a server though, you just ship the content of the disk folder to it and then configure it

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,360
to run the server.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,270
Jaspal and you're done.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,750
This is how you would deploy it.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,510
Still deploy the content of this.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,910
But now to a server, which is not a static server, but one running.

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,420
Notice that it for angular universal.

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,040
I hope this is helpful.

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,590
You can always dive much deeper into this.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,990
By the way, this is a basic introduction.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,880
This is how it works in a nutshell.

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,090
This is what it does on the fly pre rendering.

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,590
Always keep in mind you have a single page application again once it runs on a client.

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:25,140
And if you want to dive deeper, you can visit universal dot, angular dot io to find server resources

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,490
and to get a page off that project where you can also learn more post questions or issues to be precise

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,170
and dive deeper into that.

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,450
So with that, let's move on.
